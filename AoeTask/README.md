#### What does it do and what journeys are covered?

AOE official company website covers all information about AOE.  
Product, clients, careers,...

Journeys covered:

Code Flow:
â€” Check filtering of jobs
#### How does it work?

1. Tests are executed locally (did not have time to put it on Jenkins)
2. Property files located in resources folder contain desired browser

------------


#### How to run it locally:
Download zip file and unpack. Open any IDE that you have (i.e. IntelliJ), and open AoeTask Folder from unpack file.
Just as example: Clone (did not put on Git,as it is requirement) [the repository](https://forbid/to/push/on/Git) to your workspace and make sure that you have:

1. Java 11 installed
2. [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html "Apache Maven") installed on your machine and set to use jdk-11
3. Import project to your IDE and run testng.xml file located in project root by right-clicking on it and then `run` option, or through terminal:

- To execute all tests for a specific environment:\
  `mvn clean test`
- To run single test class with all tests inside:\
  `mvn clean test -Dtest=MyIntegrationTestClass`
- To run single test method:\
   `mvn clean test -Dtest=MyIntegrationTest#MyTestMethod`
------------


#### Reporting:
- When executed locally, report file can be generated by navigating to the "target" folder with command 
 "cd target" in terminal and then typing "allure serve"


**Things to note:**

- Tests are executed in parallel at method level

**Other tips and info:**

Use other report files like _index.html_ or _emailable-report.html_ located in: <em>target/surefire-reports/index.html</em> to view test results and stats in browser

Test which are marked with @Test(enabled = false) are disabled, because there are still bug related to them, or were part of should implement next,
or simply they are used as support for manual tests that are not convenient to be part of every day runs
